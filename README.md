# DEPRESSION DETECTION USING HYBRID DEEP LEARNING MODEL
## DEPRESSION DETECTION USING MOBILE APP
This project focuses on developing a mobile application that employs a hybrid deep learning model for the detection of depression. The app serves as a self-assessment tool, utilizing evidence-based questionnaires and AI-driven algorithms to evaluate users' emotional well-being and assess their risk of depression.
## FEATURES
### 1. Depression Detection:
The application uses advanced algorithms, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for facial gesture analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis, to accurately gauge users' emotional states.
### 2. Natural Language Processing (NLP):
NLP techniques are integral to the app, enabling it to understand and interpret user inputs in a meaningful way. The app can perform various tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and language generation, ensuring effective communication and tailored responses to user queries.
### 3. Facial Emotion Analysis:
The app incorporates facial recognition technology to analyze users' emotions based on their facial expressions. Using CNNs, it detects and classifies emotional states, providing additional context to the interactions and enhancing the app's ability to respond appropriately.
### 4. Interactive Chatbot:
A central feature of the application is its integrated chatbot, which combines NLP and facial recognition capabilities. When users interact with the chatbot, their text inputs are processed to understand their concerns. Simultaneously, facial expressions captured via the deviceâ€™s camera provide additional emotional context. The detected emotions are integrated into the NLP-based response generation process, allowing the chatbot to tailor its responses accordingly. Additionally, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is employed to calculate and evaluate scores based on user inputs, further enhancing the personalization of interactions. This dual approach fosters a more empathetic and supportive dialogue, ensuring that users feel understood and valued..
### 5. Support Resources:
Beyond assessment, the app offers various treatment resources, including exercises, suggestions, activities, and access to online consultations with mental health professionals. This holistic approach empowers users to manage their mental health actively.

## CONCLUSION
The mobile application for depression detection using a hybrid deep learning model offers a comprehensive self-assessment tool that integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) and facial recognition. This innovative approach allows for personalized interactions through an interactive chatbot that understands both verbal and emotional cues. By providing resources like exercises and online consultations, the app enhances accessibility to mental health care. Ultimately, this project aims to empower individuals at risk of depression, promoting effective management of mental well-being through advanced technology.
